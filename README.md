Hi, Everyone! Especially Daria Ivanova!

This repository contains a project that I did for my colleagueâ€™s ([Daria Ivanova](https://github.com/Numilou)) birthday.
Daria, happy birthday again (even if it has already passed)!

The essence of the game is terribly simple! You need to:
* Launch it; 
* Hit the ball in the trigger area; 
* And pick up the gift!
